# better-svd-for-images
Better examples for introducing SVD with images (and video!)

Everyone uses the SVD of an image as an example. We explain how using
a tiled version of the image is just better. Also, it shows some neat connections
with the discrete cosine transform used in JPG compression.

The main example of `svd-vs-tiled-svd-gray.jl`.
